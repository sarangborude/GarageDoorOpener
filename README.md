# GarageDoorOpener

Prototype for a standalone (No phone needed) garage door opener app for apple watch.

The watch connects to the adafruit bluefruit feather and controls the garage door using a relay

The app code is configured to automatically connect to the garage door bluetooth controller, so need to pair. In a production scenario, there will be one time pairing that will happen. In the prototype the focus is more on the interaction rather than on-boarding.
